# rust-mc
I have already gotten my feet wet in embedded development with rust by working through [japaric](https://github.com/japaric)'s [discovery](https://rust-embedded.github.io/discovery/README.html) book. The book does a good job of getting the reader to the fun stuff by doing most of the setup work. I hope to cement the lessons learned from the book and to get a more complete picture of starting an embedded project from scratch by re-implementing and expanding an [LED roulette application](https://rust-embedded.github.io/discovery/05-led-roulette/README.html)

## TODO
- [x] Implement LED roulette
- [ ] Expand on LED roulette with inspiration from [Fearless concurrency in your microcontroller](https://blog.japaric.io/fearless-concurrency)
