# rust-mc
I have already gotten my feet wet in embedded development with rust by working through [japaric]'s [discovery](https://rust-embedded.github.io/discovery/README.html) book. The book does a good job of getting the reader to the fun stuff by doing most of the setup work. I hope to cement the lessons learned from the book and to get a more complete picture of starting an embedded project from scratch by working through [japaric]'s first two blog posts,

* [Rust you ARM microcontroller!](https://blog.japaric.io/quickstart/)
* [Fearless concurrency in your microcontroller](https://blog.japaric.io/fearless-concurrency/)
